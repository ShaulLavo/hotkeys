# @fregat/hotkeys

keyboard shortcuts for editors and apps, with no framework and no dom in the core. it parses and matches keys, runs chords, resolves bindings against the focused context the way [zed](https://zed.dev) does, and formats shortcuts for display. adapters turn browser and terminal input into its key events. it ships no keymap

react hooks live in [`@fregat/react-hotkeys`](../react-hotkeys)

## try it

clone the repo and `bun link`, or depend on it as `workspace:*` inside Fregat

### one-call shortcuts

the registry listens on the document. arrays are chords

```ts
import { getHotkeyRegistry } from '@fregat/hotkeys'

const hotkeys = getHotkeyRegistry()
const save = hotkeys.register('Mod+S', () => saveFile())
hotkeys.register(['G', 'G'], () => scrollToTop(), { ignoreInputs: true })
save.unregister()
```

a callback that returns `false` passes the key on to the next registration

### a keymap with focus

a dispatcher holds a keymap and a tree of focus nodes. bindings name commands; nodes handle them. a key from inside an attached element resolves against that node's context and its ancestors'

```ts
import { createBrowserDispatcher } from '@fregat/hotkeys'

const keys = createBrowserDispatcher({
  keymap: [
    { keys: 'Mod+Shift+P', command: 'palette.open' },
    { keys: 'Mod+K Mod+C', command: 'comment.add', context: 'Editor' },
  ],
})
const app = keys.createNode({ commands: { 'palette.open': () => openPalette() } })
const editor = keys.createNode({ parent: app, context: 'Editor' })
editor.handle('comment.add', () => addComment())

keys.attachElement(app, document.body)
keys.attachElement(editor, editorElement)
```

`keys.setKeymap(entries)` swaps the table, e.g. after the user edits their bindings

use `readContext` for values that change with editor or plugin state. the dispatcher reads it once per node when it captures context for a key, including chord continuations and timeout replay

```ts
const editor = keys.createNode({
  parent: app,
  readContext: () => ({
    identifiers: canComment() ? ['Editor', 'canComment'] : ['Editor'],
    values: { mode: currentMode() },
  }),
})
```

`editor.context()` also reads the current context. `readContext` supplies the full context; nodes with static context can update it through `setContext`

multiple nodes can attach to the same element. the deepest live node wins; later attachments break equal-depth ties. removing a node or attachment restores the remaining registrations

hosts can subscribe to the existing browser key pipeline with `keys.observeKeys({ beforeKey, reset })`. `beforeKey(event)` runs once per event offered through `claimKeybinding` or the DOM listeners, before matching consumes claimed releases. a terminal can use it to deliver a release for a press its command sent through native encoding. `reset(reason)` clears held-key bookkeeping on blur, a hidden document, `releaseAll` and disposal. the returned function removes the subscription. subscriptions added during delivery begin with the next notification; those removed before their turn are skipped

elements with an attached `EditContext` count as text input. buffered printable chord prefixes replay through a cancellable `beforeinput` event with `inputType: 'insertText'`, letting the host apply them through its typing handler

use `capture: true` when a shared window dispatcher must hear idle keys before descendant input handlers. the default listens while events bubble. declined bindings, native navigation and composition continue to the input owner

menus can retain their origin element before focus moves. `keys.nodeForElement(origin)` finds its live attached node; `keys.dispatchCommandFrom(node, command, args)` runs along that node's path while preserving the current focus and pending chord. `keys.hasNode(node)` checks ownership of the complete path without reading context. removed or foreign nodes and disposed dispatchers decline the command

each command captures handler registrations across its whole node path before delivery. registrations added during a handler wait for the next command; removed registrations and nodes are skipped. each `node.handle` call has its own removal, even when two registrations use the same function

### display and recording

```ts
import { HotkeyRecorder, formatForDisplay } from '@fregat/hotkeys'

formatForDisplay('Mod+Shift+S', { platform: 'mac' }) // '⇧ ⌘ S'
formatForDisplay('Mod+Shift+S', { platform: 'windows' }) // 'Ctrl+Shift+S'

const recorder = new HotkeyRecorder({ onRecord: (hotkey) => saveBinding(hotkey) })
recorder.start() // Ctrl+Shift+K on linux records 'Mod+Shift+[KeyK]'
```

`Mod` is Command on mac and Control elsewhere. `[KeyK]` is a physical key, matched by position whatever the layout; the recorder writes these unless you pass `recordBy: 'key'`. logical keys on non-latin layouts fall back to `event.code`
